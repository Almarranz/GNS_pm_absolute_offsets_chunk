# GNS_pm_absolute_offsets_chunk
## Selection of an specific part of GNS 1 and 2 with a high density of Gaia stars on it
____
We are gioing to try improve the alignement by selecting smaller areas with
more Gaia stars in it.


0. gns1_B_lists.py. Combines GNS1 H and d ks lists. IN this version we do not
cutout the overlapping fields. The idea is to use more Gaia stars for the 
GNS2 fiel and see if that improves the alignemnt

1. gaia_refstars_offsets_gns_pixels.py. Give Gaia offsets cordinates and move
then to the corresponding epoch. Then uses astroaling to alingn the *gns xy 
coordenates* with the Gaia offsets.
>NOTE1:We use foregroud stars in GNS1 for m
>matching Gaia stars and use the matching stars in astroalign. If we use 
>astroalign directly with the whole lists (fore and background), aa cant find
>the transformation. The same thing we have to do with GNS2, but, since GNS2 
>only has H band, we have to match with GNS1 for foreground, so we are limited
>to the Gaia star overlapping with GNS1. Once aa has found the tranformation
>for GNS2 we aplay it to the whole GNS2 lists.

2. IDL_gaia_offset_gns_xy_align.pro Align GNS to Gaia with a polinomal of degree
1 or 2

3. IDL_GaiaRf_align_gns_offsets.pro Find matching stars and substract for pm.

3.1 gaia_stars_offsets_comp.py. Computes residuals with Gaia catalog. The point
is to get rid of the 3sigma stars and repit the alignment without then.

>NOTE: if there are any 3sigma outlayer yeild by 3.1, they have to be removed
>from the Gaia star lists at 0 and run the whoel pipeline again till no 
>3sigma outlayers are found 


4. pm_analysis_offsets_radec.py. Find and plot clusters using dbscan.

#### Quality Check

5. Hosek_cluster_com.py. Computes propermotions and position residuals between
Hosek and GNS

6. gaia_hosek_gaia_gns.py. Computes resiudals between HosekÂ´s Gaia stars and
GNS`s Gaia stars
